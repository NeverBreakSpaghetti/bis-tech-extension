## Commands

### Build

#### Development, HMR

Hot Module Reloading is used to load changes inline without requiring extension rebuilds and extension/page reloads
Currently only works in Chromium based browsers.

```sh
pnpm run dev #for chromium
pnpm run dev-firefox #for firefox
```

#### Development, Watch

Rebuilds extension on file changes. Requires a reload of the extension (and page reload if using content scripts)

```sh
pnpm run watch #for chromium
pnpm run watch-firefox #for firefox
```

#### Production

Minifies and optimizes extension build

```sh
pnpm run build #for chromium
pnpm run build-firefox #for firefox
```

### Load extension in browser

Loads the contents of the dist directory into the specified browser

```sh
pnpm serve:chrome
pnpm serve:firefox
```

### Testing

```sh
pnpm test # unit tests
pnpm build-and-test-e2e # e2e tests, extension must be built first
pnpm test:e2e # for when extension has been already built
```

> [!NOTE]  
> Right now firefox and chromium commands are separated because firefox does not support ManifestV3 completely (it still doesn't support `background.service_worker`).
